# peterdefeater
This game was made for the Object Oriented Programming module at University of Greenwich and it relied mostly on scripts to work. 
The game’s mechanics are simple as the player’s only purpose is to defeat 
enemies by shooting them, find the key which opens the door to the next level 
and to make sure the player does not run out of ammunition.
